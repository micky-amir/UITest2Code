Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie. A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email) that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites, assessing what content or ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors. Some ad companies and game developers use “flash cookies” for ads and games that use Flash media technology. We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies. Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. We use these technologies to let you navigate between pages efficiently, remember your preferences, track your use of the Services and generally improve your experience. Ad companies we work with place cookies on your computer to track your activities across various sites so that they can display ads on our Sites and third party websites that are more relevant to you and your interests.There are two broad categories of cookies:

Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser.

By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees (including any applicable taxes and other charges). Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees or recurring fees.

Any dispute arising from the Services and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of Michigan, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Michigan or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Michigan and the United States, respectively, sitting in Wayne County, Michigan.</li>
                            <li style="font-size: 14px !important; font-weight: 400 !important;">CLAIMS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION, CLASS WAIVER, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. Please read the following important section carefully.

                                    <li style="font-size: 14px !important; font-weight: 400 !important;">Except for small claims disputes or claims related to intellectual property, you and we waive our rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to the Services resolved in court. Instead, disputes relating in any way to the Services must be submitted to binding arbitration administered by JAMS. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-download and are hereby incorporated by reference. The arbitrator, not the court, will resolve the issue of arbitrability.</li>
                                    <li style="font-size: 14px !important; font-weight: 400 !important;">You and we agree that any dispute arising out of or related to the Services is personal to you and us and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.</li>
                                    <li style="font-size: 14px !important; font-weight: 400 !important;">You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You have the right to an in-person arbitration hearing in your hometown area. Any state or federal court having jurisdiction thereof may enter judgment of any award the arbitrator renders.</li>
                                    <li style="font-size: 14px !important; font-weight: 400 !important;">You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email to privacy@dictionary.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with the section, “Governing Law and Forum Selection.”</li>
                                    <li style="font-size: 14px !important; font-weight: 400 !important;">If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms of Use; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-size: 14px !important; font-weight: 400 !important;">GENERAL TERMS. These Terms and any posted rules on the Services constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No waiver by Dictionary of any breach or default under these Terms will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Our agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Dictionary and our successors, trustees, and permitted assignees. We may assign this agreement or any of its rights or obligations under these Terms with or without notice to you.</li>
